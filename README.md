Assignment 1 for CS3560 
By Seth Laske

Currently the simulator is completely randomized with a set question, answers, and number of students to be randomized, and will also run the simulation as a multiple choice question

There is no correct answer system installed, similar to the software we used in class, and going off the current question and answers I dont have a perfect answer

While I was originally using hashmaps, basic arrays ended up being simpler to implement as understand Results are maintained by saving Student IDs in a list that corresponds to each answer which allows checks (and an output could be added) for a student submitting again as well as being simple to tally at the end

The simulator is named Jeff as a reference to Survivor's Jeff Probst
